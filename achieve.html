          <h2>During my school years, I was consistently an academically bright student with a healthy amount of interest and participation in co-cirricular activities. Aside from my inclination towards Literature, Science, Maths and Data Sciences, being involved in other activities played a pivotal role in shaping my personality and confidence. These included painting, public speaking, debating, writing, music, and in a few instances, dancing; my achievemnts in all these spheres can be seen below. Additionally, I was elected as the head-girl of my school for the academic session 2016-17. As the head-girl I had manegerial and coordination duties which I completed satisfactorily with the extremely valuable support from teachers and an amazing student-council team.</h2>

          <h1>While dancing isn't something I was actively involved in, when an opportunity came, I took it. Catchcing up with my friends was tough in the beginning,  but I took it as a challenge and soon was able to follow up well. My efforts paid off as our team bagged the 3rd prize in the city-level folk dance competition in the senior category. Aside from that, I took part in group performances in some of the events our school conducted. Overall, I take all of this as an indication of my ability to try new things out and do well in them.</h1>

          <h1>I always had an inclination towards music, but it took a rigid shape only in my senior years. I never had any formal training but could play the keyboard which made me a part of the school choir. However, it was after 10th when I got a sudden urge to excel in keyboard playing which led to my two hectic jee-prep years being marked with a steep curve in my playing skills regardless of the academic pressure. I'm still learning but this just goes on to show that if I decide to do something, I will do it regardless of the circumstances. Click <a target="new" href="covers.html">here</a> to watch a few of my covers. Also, it was in 10th standard when I realised just how much I enjoyed writing songs when I wrote my first complete song before our board examinations, and I haven't looked back ever since. Click <a target="new" href="songs.html">here</a> to read a few of my songs.</h1>
